    <div class="about-martha">
      <p> My name is Martha Catherine. I am a 21 year old fresh out of college hoping to use my bachelor’s degree in Applied Physics from Georgia Tech to tutor high school kids in Physics. In college, I would study with roommates or friends and found myself explaining topics to them that I picked up pretty quick. So although I don’t have professional experience, I find that teaching my college friends was preparation for this since high school and college students are very close in age. Because Physics came so easy to me, of course it’d be my favorite subject. I can be reached by phone at 485-972-0118, but my email address mlcatherine@gmail.com is preferred.</p>
